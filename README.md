# What does this do?
Checks the validity of a pkpass file by checking its signature and contents match the Apple specification. It's hosted on Azure (at my own expense) but I wanted to post the code here, so people can a) see what it does and b) can contribute to the validation it performs.

## Motivation
Questions pop up on StackOverflow about invalid passes and the cause, usually, is a problem in the payload. This project represents my attempt to help developer diagnose the issues themselves. 

## Where is it hosted?
The project is available at https://pkpassvalidator.azurewebsites.net and can be used right now. I'll extend its capabilities over time.
