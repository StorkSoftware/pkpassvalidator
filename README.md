# Apple Wallet Pass Validator

[![Build and deploy .NET Core app to Windows WebApp pkpassvalidator](https://github.com/tomasmcguinness/pkpassvalidator/actions/workflows/pkpassvalidator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tomasmcguinness/pkpassvalidator/actions/workflows/pkpassvalidator.yml)

# What does this do?
Checks the validity of a pkpass file by checking its signature and contents match the Apple specification. It's hosted on Azure (at my own expense) but I wanted to post the code here, so people can a) see what it does and b) can contribute to the validation it performs.

## Motivation
Questions pop up on StackOverflow about invalid passes and the cause, usually, is a problem in the payload. This project represents my attempt to help developer diagnose the issues themselves. 

## Where is it hosted?
The project is available at https://pkpassvalidator.azurewebsites.net and can be used right now. I'll extend its capabilities over time.

## Can I validate my pass on the command line?

Yes, solution contains PassValidator.Console project that builds `pkpassvalidator` binary that can be used to validate pkpass files locally. Run the command without any arguments to see its usage. Binary's return code is 0 if the pass is valid. Non-zero return codes indicate validation errors.

## Support the project
If you find this utility useful and would like to contibute towards the hosting costs, please consider donating by buying me a coffee
